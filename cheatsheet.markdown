## VR

### Force use to Use X VR API

- Unity-based Games:
  - `%command% -vrmode openvr`
  - `%command% -vrmode oculus`

### My Typical collage 
  - `montage * -label '%c' -tile 3x -resize 1920x1080 -frame 2 -geometry +0+0 ./finish/result.jpg`
### Use SteamVR Controllers in No-Vive Ecosystem

TL;DR: It's will cost you about ~675.98€
which is about 400€ saves vs buying a Valve Index full Kit (1079€).

- VS Rift S Cheapest possible pricetag is 399€ (Black Friday sales).
  You only will save 4€, So It's only recommended for already users.

- VS Quest 2, You will save 104.02€ (so ,maybe could be a deal).

- VS Reverb G2 (Without Controllers), You will loss -195.98€.
