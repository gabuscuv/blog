Yeah, It isn't a joke, I did this in 2012 when I had 16 years old,

And technically was possible because Mac OS X, It's a Unix-Like System (FreeBSD) and had support for X11 Integrated at least until Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and after that, there was option for enabled installing XQuartz.

So only you need a package manager or compile the requirments by yourself one to one, and [brew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)) doesn't was popular that time, So only you have two options, use [Fink project](https://www.finkproject.org/) or use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).
I Used the last one with [this guide](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/GNOME) and after hours or days compiling, that was the result.
A Short Story but one curious (?)
