## Welcome early visitors

This blog is a bit underconstruction, but you could visit some pages.

In the about section, you can see some references from previous workmates, My Experience about Languages and Frameworks and a summary about my devices (a few of them).

In the misc section, there are some recommendation about software that I use and some cheatsheet (since how force a Game Engine use X or Y VR API to how to use SteamVR Devices in a No-Vive/Index Environment)
